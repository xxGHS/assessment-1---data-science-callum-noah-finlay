You are going to need to pip install some extensions

py -m pip install xxxx

# Read the Docs
There are a number of explainers about this set of sandbox code

1. Stuctured Workflow - you need to work on this. Get organised, test and make sure everyone can do it well
2. gitCommands - The process for running Git in a project. Use it to get familiar with doing it everyday
3. MusicSandbox - TWO parts, dataclearning.py which relates to the ReadTheDocs information
4. Lambda - More advanced way of managing simple functions
5. musicData.py - an example of how to filter dataframes
6. Jupyther Notebooks - these are like 'building blocks' of code which you can use to do analysis. Read the docs
7. Music.csv is used for the above

# Project Code
1. Cars.csv - your database
2. main.py - starter sandbox of code to help you get started
3. readShowData.py - the basic code to load in data and show a sample of what is in it.


## This is a Data Science Project
It is all about creating algorithms and functions to return information
from a large data set. To do this, you will explore 'libraries' and 'snippets'
that will make your life easier.

jupyter, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy ... and others

There are numerous tutorials you can do to build capacity in this project.

The base line solution will run in the console and will pop out some charts.

Better solutions might use Tkinter to create a GUI version and even package that as a product.

Another version might use Flask or other web-dev environment to make it a HTML5 solution.

This project will give you hands on skills - ONLY if you work on tuutorials and test the dataset. You and your partner have to choose a direction. Remember to allow 5/6 hours for the documentation of this project which will be around 20 pages including screen shots.

You must make progress and document the progress using GitHub.

There will be a weekly 'check in' with me to see progress.

Good luck
