# How to manage this project.

1.  Set up a project board: Create a project board for your team using GitHub's built-in project management tool. This will allow you and your students to track the progress of the project as it moves through different stages. Each column of the project board can represent a stage in the workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
    
2.  Assign roles: Assign each student a role within the team, such as developer, tester, or documentation writer. This will help ensure that each student has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and can work together effectively.
    
3.  Fork the repository: Each team member should fork the repository, creating their own copy of the project to work on.
    
4.  Clone the repository: Each team member should then clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git. This will create a local copy of the project that they can work on.
    
5.  Create a branch: Each team member should create a new branch from the main branch of their forked repository. This will allow them to work on their own copy of the project without interfering with the work of their teammates.
    
6.  Make changes: Each team member should make changes to the code or other project files as required, based on their assigned role.
    
7.  Commit changes: Each team member should then commit their changes to their branch, along with a clear and descriptive commit message. This will help keep track of what changes were made and why.
    
8.  Push changes: Each team member should push their branch to their forked repository on GitHub. This will upload their changes to GitHub and make them visible to their teammates.
    
9.  Create a pull request: Once a team member has completed their work on their branch, they should create a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch of the repository. The pull request should include a clear and descriptive title and description, as well as any necessary context or documentation.
    
10.  Review and merge: The other team members should then review the pull request, making comments and suggesting changes as necessary. Once the pull request has been approved, it can be merged into the main branch of the repository, integrating the changes made by the team member.
    
11.  Repeat: The process can then be repeated for each stage of the workflow, with each team member working on a new branch and creating a new pull request to merge their changes into the main branch. As the project progresses, the team can move tasks between columns on the project board to reflect their progress
