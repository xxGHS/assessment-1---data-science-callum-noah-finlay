1. df = df.apply(lambda x: x.str.strip() if x.dtype == "object" else x)

This line of code performs a data cleaning operation on a pandas DataFrame called df. The apply() function is used to apply a function to each column of the DataFrame. 

# Lambda function
## okay, this is hard to grasp, if you don't know what a function is. The easest way to thing of lambda expression are function without at name that do the sort of thing a functon usually does, but are quick to use. Don't worry if this is all a bit confusing right now, I'm giving you example expressions you can use in your project.

The function being applied is a lambda function that checks the data type of each column, and if it is an object (i.e., a string), the strip() function is applied to remove any leading or trailing spaces. 

If the data type is not an object (i.e., not a string), the original data is retained. 

In essence, this line of code removes any leading or trailing spaces from all columns of the DataFrame that contain string values.

# Examples

In Python, `lambda` is a keyword used to create anonymous functions, which are functions that have no name and are only defined with one expression. They can be useful for defining small, simple functions that don't require a name.

The general syntax of a `lambda` function is:

`lambda arguments: expression` 

Where `arguments` is a comma-separated list of arguments that the function takes, and `expression` is the one-line code to be executed in the function.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to define a simple `lambda` function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

`add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(2, 3)
print(result) # Output: 5` 

This is equivalent to defining a regular function like this:

`def add(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add(2, 3)
print(result) 
> output 5` 

Another example where `lambda` functions can be useful is when you need to pass a function as a parameter to another function. Consider the following example that uses the built-in `map()` function to apply a lambda function to each element of a list:

`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(squared_numbers)) 
 >Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` 

This is equivalent to using a for loop and defining a separate function to apply the operation to each element:

`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def square(x):
    return x ** 2
squared_numbers = []
for number in numbers:
   squared_numbers.append(square(number))
print(squared_numbers)
>Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` 

In summary, `lambda` functions are a way to create small, simple functions without having to define them with a name, and they can be useful when you need to pass a function as a parameter to another function.
