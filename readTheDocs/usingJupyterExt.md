You can use Jupyter notebooks within Visual Studio Code. To do this, you need to have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code, which can be installed from the Extensions panel.

This is a notebook extension that let's you try different data manipulations

py -m pip install jupyter

Once you have the extension installed, you can create a new Jupyter notebook by selecting "New Notebook" from the Command Palette, which can be opened using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS). In the Command Palette, search for "Jupyter" and select "New Notebook" to create a new Jupyter notebook.

You can then load your CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and perform any data analysis or manipulation using Python and pandas within the Jupyter notebook. To run a cell in the notebook, you can press Shift + Enter
