# To clean the data, you could perform the following steps in Python:

Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the data in all columns.
Remove any quotes that appear in the data, since they are not necessary and may cause issues when exporting the data.
Convert the "Release Date" column to a standard date format, such as YYYY-MM-DD, to make it easier to work with and analyse.

Does it matter if the data becomes YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY?
